# Hayahay

Hayahay is a basic home automation system which runs on the local network that can control appliances, lights, and etc., through IOT microcontrollers and a frontend GUI. It is intended to modular so that custom sensor systems can be integrated.

## Connection Redundancies
It relies on Firebase Realtime Database for allowing a secure way to control the sysystem outside of the local network. Additionally, a local Raspberry Pi broker server running on the local network is set up in case of poor or no internet connection.

## Fun Fact
'Hayahay' means 'in a relaxed or advantageous state' in Cebuano.

## Disclaimer
Some source codes are missing because of a hardware repair that deleted all my personal files back in 2022. I am now revisiting this project in my spare time so that I can properly backup the code and I can get this fully functional again. However this can happen intermittently as this system is setup at my parent's place where I am away from for most of the year due to university.
