## Disclaimer
Initial source code created in 2021 was not uploaded to Github. In 2022, a laptop repair caused all my files to be deleted. Fortunately, I had the developmet version of the APK installed on my phone so I can still extract the raw assets and dart files.

What this means is that as of April 2024, the code here may not work at all due to unresolved dependencies and missing dart files.
